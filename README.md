## Best Practices for Documentation

### 1. Minimum Viable Documentation

Focus on producing concise and accurate documentation rather than extensive, disorganized content. Regularly refine and update documentation to meet evolving needs.

### 2. Keep Documentation in Sync with Code

Update documentation alongside code changes to ensure accuracy and relevance. Reviewers should prioritize the inclusion of documentation updates in code change requests.

### 3. Eliminate Redundant Documentation

Remove outdated or unnecessary documentation to avoid confusion and maintain clarity. Encourage team participation in documentation review and cleanup processes.

### 4. Prioritize Quality Over Perfection

Strive for high-quality documentation within reasonable time frames. Emphasize continuous improvement over achieving perfection, allowing for iterative updates based on team learning and feedback.

### 5. Tell the Story of Your Code

View documentation as a narrative that enhances understanding for both humans and computers. Offer a range of documentation styles, from concise inline comments to detailed method and class documentation.

### 6. README.md Overview

Ensure README.md files provide clear overviews of project directories, file purposes, and maintenance information. Direct users to additional guides for in-depth understanding and usage instructions.
